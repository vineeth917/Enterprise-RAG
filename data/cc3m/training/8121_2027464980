into a contractual agreement with an airline. It is important to understand the fare rules associated with your ticket as they determine several aspects of your trip, including ticket validity, changes, cancellations, and more. </p>\n<p>As your order includes a booking with a low-cost carrier (LCC), their fare rules are usually stricter and different from full-service airlines. Here's a summary of the most common fare rules:</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Refundable Tickets:</strong> Due to their economical fares, most tickets issued by low-cost carriers are non-refundable.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited Changes:</strong> Changes with low-cost carriers are either not allowed or often entail fees comparable to the cost of a new ticket.</p>\n<p>Baggage Policies: Low-cost carriers usually enforce more stringent baggage policies compared to full-service airlines. Always review conditions and limitations on the airline's website before departure to ensure you are aware of their specific rules regarding checked and cabin baggage, baggage size, weight, and any associated fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Check-in:</strong> Some low-cost carriers may impose additional fees when checking in at the airport.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Certain low-cost carriers, such as WizzAir, RyanAir, and EasyJet, operate with their own ticketing system, and we might not be able to assist you directly with change or cancellation requests. However, we can help you in seeking assistance directly from the airline.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Ticket and Cancellation Products:</strong> If you purchased Flexible Ticket or any other cancellation products, contact our support team, as standard rules may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the airline's website and <a href=\"/rf/travel-conditions\" target=\"_blank\">our Travel Conditions</a> for more information.</p>","Air.Result.ImportantTripInformation.MetaPriceChange.Decrease.Text":"The price has decreased {0}, from {1} to {2}","Air.Result.ImportantTripInformation.MetaPriceChange.Decrease.Title":"The price has decreased","Air.Result.ImportantTripInformation.MetaPriceChange.Increase.Text":"Unfortunately, your ticket is no longer available at the selected price.
